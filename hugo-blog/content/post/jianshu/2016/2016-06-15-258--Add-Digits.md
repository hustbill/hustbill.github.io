Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
For example:
Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
**Follow up:**
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
**Hint:**
A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?
What are all the possible results?
How do they occur, periodically or randomly?

```java
public class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        /*
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
        dr(n)  = 1 + ((n - 1) mod 9)
        e.g. dr(371)  =   3* (100%9) + 7 * (10%9) + 1%9 = (3+7+1) % 9  = 2
        */
        int digitRoot =  1 + (( num - 1) %9);
        
        return digitRoot;
    }
    
    public int addDigits_recursive(int num) {
        int res = 0;
        while (num >= 10) {
            res += num % 10;
            num = num / 10;
        }
         res = res + num;
         return res >= 10 ?  addDigits(res) : res;
    }
}
