etcd Logo

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][raft] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

etcd is used [in production by many companies](./ADOPTERS.md), and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as [Kubernetes][k8s], [locksmith][locksmith], [vulcand][vulcand], [Doorman][doorman], and many others. Reliability is further ensured by [**rigorous testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/functional).

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.

## Community meetings

etcd contributors and maintainers have monthly (every four weeks) meetings at 11:00 AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday.

An initial agenda will be posted to the [shared Google docs][shared-meeting-notes] a day before each meeting, and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.
