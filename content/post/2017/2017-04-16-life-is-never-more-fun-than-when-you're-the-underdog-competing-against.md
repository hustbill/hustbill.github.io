“Life is never more fun than when you’re the underdog competing against the giants.”
— H. Ross Perot


[Henry Ross Perot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot) born Henry Ray Perot; June 27, 1930 – July 9, 2019) was an American business magnate, billionaire, and philanthropist. He was the founder and chief executive officer of Electronic Data Systems and Perot Systems. He ran an independent presidential campaign in 1992 and a third-party campaign in 1996, establishing the Reform Party in the latter election. Although he failed to carry a single state in either election, both campaigns were among the strongest presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate in US history.
