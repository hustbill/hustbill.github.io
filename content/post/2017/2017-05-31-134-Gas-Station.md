There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is gas[i]
.
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i]
 of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station (*i*+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
**Note:**The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
```java
// O(1) space O(n) running time solution
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int> &gas, vector<int> &cost) {

       int start = gas.size()-1;
       int end = 0;
       int sum = gas[start] - cost[start];
       while (start > end) {
          if (sum >= 0) {
             sum += gas[end] - cost[end];
             ++end;
          }
          else {
             --start;
             sum += gas[start] - cost[start];
          }
       }
       return sum >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
};
```
