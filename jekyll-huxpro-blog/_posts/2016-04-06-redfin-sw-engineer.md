Senior Software Engineer (Tour Automation) at Redfin
-----------------------------------------------------
*Job description*

Redfin is a well-funded technology startup that’s revolutionizing the $60 billion real estate industry. We use data, innovative design, and beautiful software to put the consumers first throughout the process of buying and selling homes. Get ready to dive headfirst into our award-winning website and mobile apps and solve challenging business problems in a customer friendly way. Unleash your brilliance and do work that matters. At Redfin, you’ll be part of something much bigger than just a job. If you've got fire in your belly to do work that matters, we want to hear from you.

As a senior full stack developer on the Tour Automation team, you will lead projects designed to reinvent an essential part of the home-buying process: how customers visit homes. Whether by leveraging Google’s APIs to make smarter decisions about which of our real estate agents can take a customer on tour or enabling instant confirmations of tour times, our mission is to provide choices when customers want them, enable flexibility when our agents need it, and automate the rest. Our Book It Now feature was recognized as the Most Innovative Real Estate Technology by the 2015 Inman Innovator Awards, and we’re just getting started.

*About you:*
You are a senior developer with 5+ years of experience developing large scale Java apps backed by relational databases - we use Java, Spring, Hibernate, and Postgres.
You keep up with the ever-changing landscape of JavaScript innovation, and can speak to the benefits of ES6, Node, or React.
You prefer to use pre-built technologies from proven companies like Google and Twilio, but you know when it’s time to build a tailored solution from the ground up.
You’re excited to reduce a process that takes multiple phone calls, spreadsheets, and calendars to a single click - you constantly wonder about how to make things smarter and more efficient.
You are a teacher and a mentor: you have the leadership skills (and the patience) to improve the developers around you.  

When you disagree, you disagree constructively, with respect for everyone else's opinions and ideas.  

More than anything, you share a passion for our mission to radically change the way people make one of the biggest decisions of their lives.  

*We offer:*
A mission that matters. So far, we’ve helped over 54,000 people buy and sell homes, saving them over $336M in fees!  
A management team that will inspire you with their heart and soul, and teach you how to build successful startups yourself  
Amazingly smart and fun teammates to collaborate with  
An office in downtown San Francisco with all the startup perks you’ve come to expect  
A fun, social atmosphere including catered lunches, happy hours, game and movie nights, and more!
